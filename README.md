# EVC-Data-Wrangling-Excercise

The Python script in wrangling.py combines data from CSVs, JSONs, and URLs of API results into one CSV. The file "all_users.csv" was created using data from "vendor1.csv, vendor2.json, and the URL https://randomuser.me/api/?results=500&seed=0. Before running the script, any CSV or JSON files requiring data wrangling should be in the same folder as the script and any URLs with data to be wrangled should be entered into the urls list in the wrangling.py file. Any CSV or JSON files that do not require data wrangling should not be in the same folder as the wrangling.py file as the script was written to wrangle all CSV and JSON files that are in the same directory as the script.

In addition to Python 3, you should have the Python packages Pandas and Requests installed.

I have included notebook.py, which I used as a notebook for data exploration before writing the Python script.
